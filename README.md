# Vitamin D Tracker

Description
-----------
We have basically designed a user interactive application which is to be supported by a external hardware. The application has the 
capability of calculating the vitamin D deficiency in the user by keeping track of his food intake and the body exposure to sun. A perfect 
UV index and sun burn precaution will be handled by the device and the real time alert and notification will be provided. The application 
have the capability to generate detail vitamin intake report for the user. The hardware handles the part of calculating the UV index and 
set right time for the user to the intake of dayspring.

User Case
---------
 The user will be able to see how much amount of Vitamin D is required( i.e sunlight required) to be taken by the person on a daily basis.<br>
 The user will be able to get a notification if the daily requirement is met and how to compensate for it.<br>
 The user will be able to see how many hours/min is to be spent outside in the sun to absorb the rays of sunlight.<br>
 The user can also check what is the most appropriate time to go outside the sun without getting sun burned.<br>
 The user is tracking by using the ambient light sensor to see if he/she is outside for an extended amount of time which is unhealthy.<br>

• App tracks the sun and tells you when you can get Vitamin D.<br>
• The stopwatch interface lets you set your session target by either amount of D to get or time.<br>
• Then it will count up or down to your target, applying all the factors that determine how much D you can get: skin tone, age, weight, amount of skin exposed.<br>
• All your doses of D, from the sun or supplements, are used to continuously estimate your current level.<br>
